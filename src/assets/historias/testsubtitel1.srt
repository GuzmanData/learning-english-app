TO DO THAT AND-- BUT, I MEAN,
FOR JOHN WICK ACTION IS A

45
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:16,635
PARTICULAR KIND OF ACTION.

46
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:19,672
THE DIRECTOR WANTS TO MAKE IT
IMMERSIVE AND WANTS TO MAKE IT

47
00:02:19,705 --> 00:02:22,175
LUKE A PERFORMANCE, SO IT'S
REALLY LONG TAKES.

48
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,977

A WHILE.

SEE THE FIGHT HAPPENING.

>> YEAH, IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE
THAT.

53
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,222
THE DIRECTOR HAS A VISION, THEN
THERE'S SOME CHOREOGRAPHY MOST

54
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:37,423
OF THE TIME.

55
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:41,360
AND THEN-- AND THEN WE GO, WE
REHEARSE AND THEN WE PERFORM.

56
00:02:41,393 --> 00:02:44,597
>> Stephen: A SINGLE FIGHT,
LET'S SAY ONE FIVE-MINUTE FIGHT,

57
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,666
YOU MIGHT DO, HOW LONG ARE YOU
TRAINING FOR THAT FIGHT?

58
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,934
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS.

59
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,904
SO THEY DON'T-- OKAY SO, THERE'S
A COUPLE FIGHTS WHERE WE TRAINED

60
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:55,374
A COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT WHAT
REALLY HAPPENS IS FOR ME, THEY

61
00:02:55,407 --> 00:03:01,013
GET-- I GET BASICALLY LIKE A
JOHN WICK TOOLBOX SO I'LL KNOW

62
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,482
HOWEVER MANY JUDO THROWS.

63
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:06,752
THEY'LL CHOREOGRAPH MOST OF THE
JUJITSU.

64
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,921
WITH THE HORSE, THERE'S A HORSE
FIGHT NOW.

65
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,890
SO I HAVE TO DO SOME --
>> Stephen: YOU FIGHT A HORSE.

66
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,491
>> I HAD TO GET OFF THE SADDLE.

67
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:15,728
NO, I'M ON THE HORSE AND THEN --
>> Stephen: THE HORSE IS

68
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,262
FIGHTING.

69
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:16,729
THE HORSE IS FIGHTING.

70
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:17,830
>> IT'S JOHN WICK.

71
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,566
IT'S LIKE, INSTEAD OF JUST
RIDING THE HORSE YOU HAVE TO

72
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:23,603
HAVE A GUN FIGHT AND DO ALL OF
THAT SORT OF STUFF.

73
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,538
>> Stephen: WHAT IS IT LIKE TO
FIGHT ON A HORSE?

74
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,139
>> IT'S FUN.

75
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,107
 ( LAUGHTER ).

76
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:28,841
>> Stephen: DOES THAT MAKE YOU
NERVOUS AT ALL?

77
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:29,575
>> NO!

78
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:30,409
IT'S A MOVIE!

79
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:31,176
IT'S FUN!

80
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,812
>> Stephen: BUT THE HORSE IS
REAL.

81
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,147
YOU COULD GETUE COULD GET THROWN
AND TRAMPLED.

82
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,983
>> YEAH, YOU CAN DIE.

83
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,085
 ( LAUGHTER )
BUT THE THING IS-- BUT THE THING

84
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,853
IS, I MEAN --
>> Stephen: I WASN'T GOING TO

85
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,521
GO THAT FAR, BUT THAT'S TRUE.

86
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:43,789
>> THAT'S WHAT CAN HAPPEN.

87
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:47,994
BUT THEY HAVE A SAFETY SYSTEM SO
THEY CREATED THIS RIG, WITH THE

88
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,562
HORSE BEHIND A TRUCK AND THE
THING --

89
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,231
>> Stephen: THEY STRAP THE
HORSE BEHIND A TRUCK.

90
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:53,032
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

91
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,568
>> WELL KIND-- IT'S VERY
COMPLICATED.

92
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:56,836
BUT ANYWAY, YOU WON'T SEE THAT
IN THE MOVIE.

93
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:00,039
I'LL JUST BE RIDING, AND IT WILL
LOOK-- HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL

94
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,875
ENJOY IT, BUT--
 ( APPLAUSE )

95
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:07,079
 ( CHEERS )
BUT IT'S JOHN WICK!

96
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:09,181
>> Stephen: I THINK WE HAVE--
I THINK WE HAVE AN IMAGE-- I

97
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:10,583
THINK WE HAVE AN IMAGE.

98
00:04:10,616 --> 00:04:11,584
IS THIS THE HORSE THING?

99
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,819
>> YEAH, YEAH, BUT THAT'S
ACTUALLY JUST RIDING.

100
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:15,488
>> Stephen:  THAT'S JUST
RIDING, OKAY.

101
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,722
>> THAT'S JUST RIDING.

102
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,658
THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER THING THAT
HAPPENS.

103
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,691
>> Stephen: DID YOU KNOW HOW
TO RIDE BEFORE THIS?

104
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:20,893
>> YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

105
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:21,961
A LITTLE BIT.

106
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,462
>> Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER
PLAYED A COWBOY?

107
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:24,230
>> NO.

108
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:25,464
>> Stephen: OKAY.

109
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:26,532
>> YEAH.

110
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:27,400
I'D LIKE TO.

111
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,434
A WESTERN WOULD BE FUN.

112
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,568
>> Stephen: SURE.

113
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:33,539
>> BUT WITH THIS IT WAS JUST--
YOU KNOW, I WORKED WITH A

114
00:04:33,572 --> 00:04:37,443
SECOND-GENERATION HORSE MASTER
TAD GRIFFITH AND HIS FAMILY.

115
00:04:37,476 --> 00:04:42,081
YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY WHAT
HAPPENS A LOT WITH JOHN WICK IS

116
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:45,885
YOU GET TO MEET THESE GREAT
INSTRUCTORS AND TEACHERS.

117
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,386
HEAL BERRY WORKED ON THE FILM.

118
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,855
SHE WAS GREAT, AND SHE WENT INTO
JOHN WICK ACTION.

119
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:53,693
SHE WORKED WITH TWO BELGIAN
DOGS.

120
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,527
HER CHARACTER HAS DOGS.

121
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,430
AND SHE TRAINED WITH THEM FOR
OVER --

122
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:57,997
>> Stephen: THAT'S THIS.

123
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,833
>> THAT'S THE SHOT.

124
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,002
SHE HAD TO DO SOME JOHN WICK
ACTION.

125
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:06,005
WHICH THEN SHE TRAINED FOR
ABOUT-- OVER SIX MONTHS.

126
00:05:06,038 --> 00:05:07,873
>> Stephen: SO YOU'RE WORKING
WITH HORSES.

127
00:05:07,906 --> 00:05:09,275
YOU'RE WORKING WITH DOGS.

128
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,478
IS IT HARD TO WORK WITH THE
ANIMALS ON SET?

129
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:16,716
>> NO, AS LONG AS YOU BUILD,
"LIKE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

130
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,352
>> Stephen: WHAT WAS YOUR
RELATIONSHIP TO THESE DOGS?

131
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,586
 (  LAUGHTER  ).

132
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,256
>> I DIDN'T DO THE HALLE BERRY
SIX-MONTH TRAINING BECAUSE THEY

133
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:25,457
WERE HER DOGS.

134
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,494
OKAY, AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE
FIRST DAY THAT I WENT TO TRAIN

135
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,764
WITH HEAL WHO HAD BEEN TRAINING
WITH WONDERFUL DOGS, THE TRAINER

136
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,900
SAID, "SO HALLEY'S GOING TO
STAND THERE.

137
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,169
THERE SHE IS AND THERE ARE HER
TWO DOGS.

138
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,771
YOU'RE GOING TO WALK UP TO THEM.

139
00:05:38,804 --> 00:05:39,905
DON'T LOOK AT THEM.

140
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,474
DON'T LOOK AT THEM IN THE EYE."

141
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,675
>> Stephen: WHY.

142
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:46,912
>> BECAUSE THEY'LL-- THEY-- THEY
MIGHT DO SOMETHING NOT GOOD.

143
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:52,151
NOW, THESE ANIMALS ARE REALLY
BEAUTIFUL AND FRIENDLY AND

144
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:52,952
AWESOME --
>> Stephen: AS LONG AS YOU

145
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,553
DON'T LOOK AT THEM.

146
00:05:54,586 --> 00:05:56,021
 ( LAUGHTER )
THAT SOUNDS REALLY DANGEROUS.

147
00:05:56,054 --> 00:06:02,561
DID YOU GO, "YOU KNOW, NO MORE
'JOHN WICK' MOVIES IF THAT DOG

148
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:03,662
TAKES MY FACE OFF."

149
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:06,265
>> NO, YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY
ATTENTION.

150
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:09,468
AND EVENTUALLY I GOT TO KNOW
THEM BETTER AND HE STILL TOLD ME

151
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,505
NOT TO LOOK AT THEM.

152
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:17,777
HALE WORKED SO MUCH THE TRAINER
TOLD ME-- HALE BY THE END WAS

153
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,477
HELLO.

154
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,711
AND GIVING COMMANDS.

155
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:24,717
AND IF YOU SEE THE FILM, IT'S
PRETTY SPECTACULAR WHAT THEY DO

156
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,951
TOGETHER.

157
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,620
>> Stephen: DID THE HORSE EVER
GET SPOOKED BY THE DOGS OR, LIKE

158
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,022
--
>> NO, THEY NEVER MET EACH

159
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:30,489
OTHER.

160
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:30,756
>> Stephen: OKAY.

161
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,024
>> NO.

162
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:38,330
BUT DOG THEY HAD IN "JOHN WICK"
ESCAPED ONCE IN TIMES SQUARE AT

163
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:40,499
5:00 IN THE MORNING ASK WENT
AFTER ONE THOSE OF HORSES WITH

164
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:41,667
THE CARTS.

165
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,303
>> Stephen: THE FIRST DOG--
>> I MEAN, IT DIDN'T GO AFTER

166
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:45,571
IT.

167
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:46,605
WE WERE DOING A SCENE, AND THEN
THE HORSE AND THE THING, AND THE

168
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:50,342
DOG WENT, "OH!"
AND IT DID A DOG THING.

169
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,447
IT WENT AFTER THE-- OH, YEAH,
AND THEN THERE WAS-- WHEN WE

170
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,551
WERE IN MOROK OH, YEAH, THERE
WERE THE DOGS AND A LOT OF CATS.

171
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,288
SO WE HAD, LIKE, CAT CHAOS.

172
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,623
>> Stephen: ARE THESE TRAINED
CATS OR WILD CATS?

173
00:07:04,656 --> 00:07:06,792
>> THESE ARE WILD CATS WITH THE
DOGS.

174
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,763
SO THEN WE WOULD BE DOING A
SCENE AND, "CAT!

175
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:11,697
CAT!

176
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,999
CAT!"
AND THE DOGS WERE JUST LIKE BUT

177
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:17,303
THE THING IS WITH THE DOGS, YOU
CAN'T JUST GRAB THE DOG BECAUSE

178
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,005
IF YOU --
>> Stephen: RIGHT, BECAUSE...

179
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:20,806
EXACTLY.

180
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,376
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE EYE
CONTACT.

181
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:24,843
YES, UH-HUH.

182
00:07:24,876 --> 00:07:26,078
>> EXCITING TIMES.

183
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,180
>> Stephen: YEAH.

184
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:29,615
WE HAVE A CLIP HERE.

185
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:30,783
THIS IS NOT THE HORSE?

186
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:31,350
WHAT IS THIS?

187
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,418
THIS IS THE MOTORCYCLE.

188
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:33,219
>> YES.

189
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,520
>> Stephen: THIS IS THE
MOTORCYCLE.

190
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:35,654
WHAT'S GOG HERE?

191
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,390
>> WE WANTED TO OPEN UP THE JOHN
WICK ACTION IN THE FILM.

192
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,793
WE HAD SOME HORSES AND SOME
DOGS.

193
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:44,663
AND NOW THE DIRECTOR HAD THE
IDEA OF NINJAS AND A MOTORCYCLE

194
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:45,631
FIGHT.

195
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:46,198
>> Stephen: SURE, OBVIOUSLY,
THAT'S A NATURAL.

196
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:47,600
>> IT'S JOHN WICK, BABY!

197
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,736
>> Stephen: COME ON.

198
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:51,036
JIM.

199
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,875
WICK IT.

200
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:27,206
 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> IT'S FUN.

201
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,942
IT'S FUN!

202
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,811
>> Stephen: WELL, YOUR FANS
ARE PRETTY DARN EXCITED ABOUT A

203
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:33,946
RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT.

204
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,948
YOU'RE REPRIZING ANOTHER CLASSIC
ROLE FROM YOUR PAST.

205
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:41,020
YOU AND YOUR FRIEND ALEX WINTER
ANNOUNCED THAT--

206
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:51,797
 ( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
BILL AND TED ARE COMING BACK.

207
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,167
ANYTHING WE CAN KNOW ABOUT--
WHAT ARE THEY-- WHAT ARE THEY

208
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,268
DEALING WITH IN THIS ONE?

209
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,070
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT
IT.

210
00:08:58,103 --> 00:09:01,574
>> SURE, RIGHT NOW IT'S CALLED
"BILL AND TED FACE THE MUSIC."

211
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,310
AND WE'RE FINDING THEM HOWEVER
MANY YEARS LATER-- I THINK IT'S

212
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,578
OVER 25.

213
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,949
AND THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO WRITE
THE SONG THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

214
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,284
UNITE THE WORLD AND BRING PEACE
AND EVERYTHING, BUT THEY

215
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,051
HAVEN'T.

216
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,954
AND SO WHAT HAS THAT DONE TO
THEM?

217
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:15,821
>> Stephen: A LOT OF PRESSURE.

218
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,590
>> IT'S A --
>> Stephen: LOT OF PRESSURE.

219
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:18,858
>> PRESSURE.

220
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,093
AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR FAMILY NOW,
BUT YOU'RE STILL TRYING TO WRITE

221
00:09:21,126 --> 00:09:22,995
THE SONG BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
SAVE THE WORLD!

222
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:26,932
BUT THEN THE FUTURE COMES DOWN
AND SAYS, "WELL, NO, YOU DON'T

223
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,534
REALLY JUST HAVE TO SAVE THE
WORLD.

224
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,803
YOU HAVE TO SAEFORT UNIVERSE,
AND YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE SONG

225
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,405
IN, LIKE, 80 MINUTES."

226
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:34,573
>> Stephen: WOW.

227
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,508
>> THIES PROBLEM BECAUSE WE
HAVEN'T WRITTEN A SONG IN OVER

228
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,178
25 YEARS, SO WHAT ARE WE GOING

229
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,781
>> Stephen: WHAT HAPPENS TO
YOU IF YOU DON'T THIS DO THIS?

230
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:46,385
>> IT'S THE END OF THE UNIVERSE
AND TIME AND SPACE.

231
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,353
>> Stephen: YOU'RE FACING YOUR
MORTALITY AND ALL OF EXISTENCE?

232
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,087
>> YEAH.

233
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,155
>> Stephen: WOW.

234
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:52,958
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN

235
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:58,330
 (  LAUGHTER  )
>> I KNOW THAT THE ONES WHO LOVE

00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:02,601
US WILL MISS US.

237
